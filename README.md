# Reason de Etre
Do we want an amazing, mission driven, insightful origin story; years before anyone else thought this was as good idea or that it was worth doing? Of course. Am I also just a guy who wants the easiest way to some decent food tonight without feeling guilty about ordering the same old delivery again while those last few stalks of celery go rotten in the veggie drawer again? You bet thats me.

Welcome a practical approach to cooking at home. I aim to answer some really basic questions with this project:
1. Whats for dinner tonight/tomorrow/this week?
2. Do I need to buy anything today/tomorrow/this week?
3. What is the path of least resistence if I don't have a plan? What if I don't want to buy that one ingredient? What if I have something similar?
4. Am I wasting any food? Can I prevent that potential waste?
5. How much of this can be automated to save time while still having a high quality at home cooking experience?
